# hello-next

This a basic NextJs app, that can be used as a sacaffold for building real apps. 

## CSS-in-JS implemented using EmotionJs and Styled-Components

Its fully integrated with EmotionJS and Styled-System and configured with a basic `theme`, so its ready to use for building primitives/atoms components to build an own component-library. 

Already have a Box component implementing all system-functions that makes you able to pass css via props. 

Check for emotionjs and Styled-System


// TODO
A good idea would be to finish up a basic on `uiLibrary` creating basic components (using smooth-ui as example) to have a reusable library for another apps.


## Fully configured with now.sh, 'Serverless aproach'

Its configured to produce a deploy the app on each PULL-REQUEST into a now.sh environement.

Its using serverless aproach which will build a lambda for each page. This a feature that combined with now nextjs page-independent appoach works perfectly
